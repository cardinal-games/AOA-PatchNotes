# AOA-PatchNotes
#Build 0.1.11

- Combat update: mobs now use VFX and a more varied attack palette.
- Equipment has had the 100% evasion rate removed. Players can actually take hits now.
- Equipment stats have also been rebalanced for Trainee and Adventurer sets.
- New sound framework: all sounds in the game are run through it so environment SFX will act differently.
- There are missing sounds, especially around water areas, but it's still WIP.
